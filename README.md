## Fincounter

This project is an in development fishing app I am producing called Fincounter.

## About


### What is it?

Fincounter is a low input/high output app for recording your fishing sessions.<br />


### What does it do?

Fincounter allows you to back up your fishing intuition with evidence. It creates easy to understand data visualisations on a variety of variables to help you understand what works where. 


### How does it work? 

The app has very few dependencies, it uses react for rendering, react router for navigation and react bootstrap for styling. All the data is stored in local storage meaning the app works without a signal. Weather data is supplied by the open weather map API and satelite imagery from the mapquest API. Everthing else is HTML, Javascript and CSS.
